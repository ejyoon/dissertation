Language learning is hard.

Social learning.

Statistical learning.

Active learning. 

Integrative framework of active learning within social contexts. Decision-making motivated by utility of action for learning goal. Using this framework, we can ask how social and statisical information selectively affect different underlying components of information selection. 

Eye movements as particularly intresting query to study if interested in the confluence of social, statistical, and active learning. Children can control this behavior early in development and linking visual and linguistic information via eye movements as been proposed as one the primary tasks in early language comprehension and word learning.

Overview of the argument: Why integrate these frameworks?
