We use and hear polite speech on a daily basis, ranging from simple words of apology (“sorry”) or gratitude (“thanks”) to compliments (“I love your dress!”) and requests (“Can you please open the window?”).
Adults and even young children spontaneously produce requests in polite forms [@clark1980; @axia1985]. 
Speakers exhibit politeness strategies even while arguing, preventing unnecessary offense to their interactants [@holtgraves1997]. 
Listeners even attribute ambiguous speech to a polite desire to hide a truth that could hurt another’s self-image [e.g., @bonnefon2009]. 
In fact, it is difficult to imagine human speech that efficiently conveys only the truth. 
Intuitively, politeness is one prominent characteristic that differentiates human speech from stereotyped robotic communication, which may try to follow rules to say “please” or “thank you” yet still lack genuine politeness.

Although language users use polite speech on a daily basis, explaining why we use polite speech or how we understand it is not as straightforward as it first seems.
While very simple polite utterances can be produced from straightforward rules (e.g., say “sorry” when you did something bad to someone), 
When speakers want to tell the listener to “close the window,” they often use a more roundabout way and say “can you please close the window?”
When people see that their interactant is wearing a new outfit that they think is hideous, they might still say “Your dress looks gorgeous!”
As such, polite utterances often seem to misrepresent their intended message or conceal the truth,
which shows that polite speech violates a critical principle of cooperative communication: exchanging information efficiently and accurately [@grice1975].

If politeness only gets in the way of effective information transfer, why be polite?
Clearly, there are social concerns, and most linguistic theories assume utterance choices are motivated by these concerns, couched as either polite maxims [@leech1983], social norms [@ide1989], or aspects of a speaker and/or listener’s identity, known as *face* [@brown1987; @goffman1967]. 
All of these theories use different approaches to explain polite language, and some are even framed as counterarguments to existing theories [e.g., see @watts2003 and @matsumoto1988 for counterarguments to some issues in @brown1987]. One possible commonality among these theories however, is that they all describe ways in which language communication deviates from certain expected utterances or conversations due to speakers’ social concerns. 

In this thesis, my goal is to offer an integrative theoretical framework that aims to unify these existing theories, and provide empirical evidence in support of this framework. Specifically, I argue for a *goal-based* theory of polite speech: that polite utterances arise from competing social goals that speakers have, such as their desires to convey information as truthfully and efficiently as possible ("informational goal"), to make the listeners feel happy and respected and thereby boost or maintain their face ("prosocial goal"), and to present speakers themselves in a good light (e.g., that they are kind and helpful; "presentational goal"). Speakers then have to consider the tradeoff between these goals, and think about which goal to prioritize and how much to do so to determine their utterance.

For example, imagine that Alice and Bob are having a conversation and Bob asks for Alice's feedback on his cookies that he baked ("How did you like my cookies?") and Alice thinks the cookies tasted bad and salty (Figure\ \ref{fig:schematic-overview}, top panel). Alice's utterance would differ depending on her goals: whether she wants to prioritize informational goal or telling the truth to Bob; social goal or making Bob feel happy; or presentational goal or presenting Alice herself in a good light that she is kind (Predictions of this specific scenario will be explained in detail in Chapter 2).

The contents of this dissertation will be as follows, as shown in Figure 1:
In Chapter 1 (top panel of Figure\ \ref{fig:schematic-overview}) I present an integrative goal-based framework that aims to explain polite speech based on the idea that it reflects a tradeoff between competing social goals that speakers have. Then using this framework, I will explain existing empirical studies on understanding and production of polite speech in adults and children. 
Chapters 2-4 describe a set of computational and empirical studies of children and adult's understanding of polite language (bottom panels of Figure\ \ref{fig:schematic-overview}) . In Chapter 2, I provide a computational model that formalizes the notion of goals as utilities that speakers try to maximize through language use, and show that this model successfully captures adults’ predictions and judgments for polite lies and indirect speech. Then I present two sets of empirical studies looking at the development of polite language understanding: Chapter 3 examines 2- to 4-year-old children’s judgments for polite requests, and Chapter 4 looks at 5- to 8-year-old children’s judgments for polite lies versus blunt truths.
