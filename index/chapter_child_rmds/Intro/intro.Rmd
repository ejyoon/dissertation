Word learning seems simple. An adult produces a word about something in the surrounding context (e.g., "look at the ball") and the child connects what they hear with the round object that they see in front of them. This characterization of word learning via association belies the complexity of the acquisition challenge faced by children. Consider that even to learn the meaning of concrete nouns children have to extract the correct units from a continuous stream of linguistic information and map them on another continous stream of visual information. The word-to-meaning mapping task becomes even more complex if we consider that a speaker’s intended meaning is largely unconstrained by the co-occurring context; a point made famous by W.V. Quine’s example of a field linguist trying to select the target meaning of a new word ("gavagai") from the set of possible meanings consistent with the event of a rabbit running (e.g., "white," "rabbit," "dinner," etc.) [@quine19600]. Remarkably, children's word learning proceeds rapidly, with estimates of adult vocabularies ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 distinct lexical concepts [@bloom2002children].

The number of word meanings children will acquire is not the only impressive feature of their lexical development. As children accumulate word knowledge, they also gain the ability to access the conceptual representation connected with a word quite rapidly. Consider that children are able to understand language even though adults speak at a rate of three words per second. Moreover, empirical work shows that both adults and young children shift their visual attention to a familiar object in the scene within hundreds of milliseconds upon hearing its name [@spivey2002eye; @allopenna1998tracking; @tanenhaus1995integration]. The speed of lexical access is highlighted when compared with the slower retrieval of other learned, arbitrary facts (e.g., phone numbers) [@pinker2003language]. 

Taken together, these facts make children's lexical comprehension and acquisition important topics of study for cognitive science. How is it that nearly all children growing up under typical circumstances acquire language quite rapidly despite noise and an in principle unlimited amount of referential uncertainty in the input? What learning mechanisms could account for the robustness and flexiblity of language development?  

Social learning accounts point out that each child does not have to re-invent language on their own. Instead, children are typically surrounded by parents, other knowledgeable adults, or older peers -- all of whom know the target language and want to facilitate their learning [@bloom2002children; @clark2009first; @hollich2000breaking]. Statistical learning theories propose that children possess powerful pattern detection skills that can learn the consistent structure in their input and reduce ambiguity in the learning task [@yu2007rapid; @siskind1996computational; @roy2002learning]. More recent theories highlight the role child as active learner, controlling aspects of their own learning via the selection of behaviors -- for example, asking questions or choosing where to allocate visual attention -- that change the content, pacing, and sequence of their learning experiences [@gopnik1999scientist; @schulz2012origins]. A common thread in the three accounts -- social, statistical, and active -- is that children have access to information that *constrains* their inferences about new word meanings, thus reducing the problem of indeterminancy. 

While the study of these learning accounts have typically proceeded in parallel, in real-world learning, these mechanisms do not operate in isolation. Thus, it is important to develop integrative accounts that try to explain how different sources of information might mutually influence one another to support lexical development. But how should we integrate these proposals? In this thesis, I argue that answering this question represents a significant step towards a more complete theory of early language acquisition since children's word learning often unfolds within socially grounded learning contexts. Put simply, children acquire language from other people, creating a scenario where they can integrate social information with their prior knowledge of word meanings to decide what actions to take.

Chapter 1 presents the details of an integrative account of how children's active learning might be shaped by information present in social contexts. I use the computational framework of Optimal Experiment Design [@emery1998optimal; @lindley1956measure] as a conceptual tool to bring social learning processes into contact with the underlying decision making that supports active learning. The key insight is that learning in the presence of other people plays a direct role in determining the *usefulness* of different actions. Using this framework allows us to ask how social and statisical information might selectively affect the different underlying components of children's information selection during lexical comprehension and word learning.

In Chapters 2-5, I present a diverse set of case studies of children and adult's eye movements during real-time familiar language comprehension and novel word learning. The empirical work focuses on eye movements as one instantiation of an active learning behavior that is particularly relevant for early lexical development. That is, decisions about visual fixation can be cast as a type of question-asking where perceivers deploy their gaze to reduce uncertainty about the world and to maximize their expected future rewards with respect to some goal [@hayhoe2005eye]. Morever, eye movements, as opposed to verbal question asking, are a behavior that children can control relatively early in development and map well on to the ecological task of interest: linking linguistic and visual information about concrete objects, which are perceived via the visual channel. Overall, the goal fo the empierical work is to ask how children's real-time visual information selection adapts to the information available in very different processing contexts.

Chapter 2 presents the first case study, which explores how children's eye movements during real-time language comprehension adapt to the context of processing a signed language. In this case, both the referents (objects)  and the linguistic signal (signs) are visual and can compete for children's fixations. How do children learning sign choose to divide their visual attention between signers and objects?

Chapter 3 builds on the sign language work and directly compares children's gaze dynamics during signed and spoken language comprehension. Morever, Chapter 3 compares spoken language learners' eye movements when processing language produced by a video of a speaker's face to language coming from a disembodied voice. This comparison allows us to ask how the presence of social partner changes how listeners choose to gather visual information from objects vs. faces. Finally, Chapter 3 presents an information-seeking explanation of the differences in gaze dynamics between spoken and signed language learners. This explanation draws ideas directly from the conceptual analysis of active learning within social contexts proposed in Chapter 1.

Finally, Chapters 4 and 5 generalize the information seeking explanation to the domain of novel word learning. Chapter 4 presents a series of large-scale word learning experiments, showing that the presence of social cues can change how adults choose to distribute attention and memory during statistical word learning. Finally, Chapter 5 presents an eye tracking study that attempts to bring together elements of all three pieces of the integrative account -- social, statistical, and active -- presented in Chapter 1. We measured how children's active decisions about whether to look at a social target (a speaker's face) or at novel objects changes as a function of gaining more exposure to statistical information about word-object links.
