In this chapter, we present two studies of eye movements during real-time familiar language processing. Within our broader active-social framework, these studies explore whether children adapt their eye movements to query locations in response to the utility of that location with respect to their goal of rapid language comprehension. Morover, these studies investigate children's decisions to stop fixating on a social partner and seek a named referent, sythensizing threshold models of decision making, stopping rules, and language-driven visual attention. 

Understanding grounded language involves linking the incoming linguistic signal to the visual world. Information that is gathered through visual fixations can facilitate the comprehension process. But how do listeners decide what visual information to gather? Here, we propose that children flexibly adapt their gaze to seek visual information from social partners to support language understanding. We present evidence for our explanation using two case studies of eye movements during real-time language processing: children learning spoken English vs. young ASL-learners and spoken English in noisy vs. clear auditory environments. Acoss both studiees, we found that when it was higher value, listeners fixated longer on a social partner, genereated more shifts that landed on the named referent, and a higher proportion of language-driven gaze shifts. These results suggest that children can adapt their information gathering thresholds to seek additional visual information from their social partners that supports their real-time language comprehension.
