In this chapter, we present two studies of eye movements during real-time familiar language processing. Within our broader active-social framework, these studies explore whether children adapt their eye movements to query locations that are more useful for the goal of rapid language comprehension. Moreover, these studies investigate some factors that influence children's decisions of when to stop fixating on a social partner and seek a named referent, synthesizing work on threshold models of decision making with research on language-driven visual attention. 

Real-time language comprehension involves linking the incoming linguistic signal to the visual world. Information gathered via visual fixations can facilitate the comprehension process. But do listeners seek language-relevant visual information? Here, we propose that children flexibly adapt their eye movements to seek information from social partners that supports language understanding. We present evidence for our explanation using two case studies of eye movements during real-time language processing: children learning spoken English vs. children learning American Sign Language and children processing English in noisy vs. clear auditory environments. Across both studies, we found that listeners adapted their gaze to fixate longer on a social partner when it was useful for language comprehension. Fixating longer on their social partner led to a higher proportion of gaze shifts landing on the named objects, and more language-driven, as opposed to random, shifts. These results suggest that children can increase their information gathering thresholds to seek additional visual information from social partners that supports real-time language comprehension.
