# Conclusion {-#conclusion}

In this dissertation, I proposed a framework for understanding children's information seeking decisions within social contexts. The core of the argument is that the presence of other people can change the *availability* and *usefulness* of information seeking behaviors by shaping the learner's goals, hypotheses, actions, answers, and decisions about when to stop gathering information. Following the theoretical account, I presented a set of empirical work that explored whether the dynamics of children's real-time information selection via eye movements flexibly adapted to their social context to support language processing.

Chapter 2 investigated how children learning American Sign Language (ASL) allocated attention between language and objects, which both compete for visual attention. Similar to children learning spoken language, ASL learners shifted gaze away from a social partner to seek objects before sign offset, providing evidence that, despite the higher value of fixating on a signer, grounded language drove rapid shifts in attention to named referents during ASL processing. Chapter 3 extended the sign language research by directly comparing ASL learners' gaze dynamics to children learning spoken English on parallel language comprehension tasks. Chapter 3 also described a comparison of English-learning children and adult's eye movements in noisy auditory contexts. Both ASL learners and children processing speech in noise showed parallel adaptations to the higher value of looking to their social partner to gather language-relevant information before shifting gaze seek a named referent. Chapters 4 and 5 explored how the information seeking changed when children and adults were processing words in the context of social cues to reference. These results suggest learners integrate uncertainty over word-object mappings with the availability of social information to select visual fixations that, in turn, modulate the information that comes into contact with statistical learning mechanisms. 

Nevertheless, both the integrative account and the empirical work described here are limited in significant ways. First, the majority of this research tested binary hypotheses of behavior change -- e.g., sign vs. spoken language; noisy vs. clear speech; word learning with vs. without social gaze -- to answer the question of *whether* children would flexibly adapt their information seeking. Chapters 2-5 provide evidence across a diverse set of case studies that they do. However, for the integrative account to be more useful, we would want to develop a fully-specified computational model that can make quantitative predictions for how social contexts would change the utility of information seeking behaviors. This step will require formalizing the value and cost of information seeking actions in a modeling framework that can incorporate the effects of reasoning about other people's mental states. We have taken initial steps towards this goal, showing that a Bayesian model that integrated ideas from Optimal Experiment Design and recursive social reasoning could capture adults' decisions to forego information seeking in favor of more immediately rewarding actions when performance/presentational goals were highlighted by social partners in a causal learning task [@yoon2018balancing]. I hope that future versions of this active-social learning account will generate graded, testable predictions for behavior across a variety of domains.

Second, we used one formalization of active inquiry that focused on learners' actions given a specific and a set of candidate hypotheses. There are, however, other computational frameworks that have formalized human information seeking in different ways. For example, foraging models pursue the analogy that human information seeking is akin to animals' decisions about where and how long to look for food if their goal was to maximize caloric intake while minimizing effort and time (see @pirolli1999information for a review). Cognitive scientists have successfully modeled a range of behaviors as foraging, such as searching for concepts in memory [@hills2012optimal] and decisions about where to direct visual attention [@manohar2013attention]. In addition to search models, recent theories of curiosity-based learning in developmental robotics have developed algorithms that optimize intrinsic estimates of learning progress such that the system will focus on activities and stimuli of intermediate complexity where predictions are steadily improving, and uncertainty is steadily decreasing [@oudeyer2016evolution]. One of the challenges for researchers trying to integrate active and social learning is that the space of possible connections is quite large. We hope that by restricting our account to active decision making with social learning contexts will allow for progress in understanding one important sub-component of children's complex information seeking behaviors.

Third, our ultimate goal is to enrich the integrative active-social account to incorporate effects at the developmental timescale. The experiments in this thesis, however, often treated children and adults as two endpoints on a continuum to explore parallels and differences between children's information seeking and our best estimate of the mature state. The final experiment in Chapter 5 represents an exception where we measured children's adaptation of information seeking over the slightly longer timescale of multiple exposures to novel word-object links and compared this to their gaze patterns when processing highly familiar words, which they learned through exposure to many prior labeling events in their day-to-day experience. While this study is a useful first step, future work should measure developmental change over a longer timescale by densely sampling children at different ages and points of cognitive development. For example, it would be useful to know how children's rapidly improving productive language skill provides with a much wider range of information seeking actions in the form of verbal questions. One prediction of our account is that seeking social information via eye movements should become less useful when children can select the action "What is this thing called?" Another example of children's rapid theory of mind development. Our account predicts that young children should focus more on learning goals if they are less skilled at reasoning about others' beliefs. But, as their social reasoning abilities mature and their social environments become more complex, children may start to emphasize performance or presentation goals to update others' beliefs and appear competent.

Finally, the goal of the empirical research described here was to understand how children's information seeking behaviors adapt to support language processing. To accomplish this, we measured changes in children's gaze dynamics as they comprehended and learned words in highly-simplified contexts. This approach has the benefit of providing a high degree of experimenter control and relatively well-understood hypotheses linking external behavior (eye movements) to underlying psychological constructs (e.g., lexical knowledge) (although see XXX for a review of the challenges with interpreting the meaning of eye movements). The risk, however, is that the stimulus responses that we can measure in the lab do not reflect behaviors that support children's learning in their natural environments. That is, children learn their first language from conversation where there is dynamic back-and-forth turn taking and where the child's social partner is also making active decisions that control the flow of experience. This gap suggests two critical next steps for this line of work: (1) measure changes in children's information seeking within free-flowing social interactions with caregivers (see @franchak2011head for an example using head-mounted cameras). And (2) develop more realistic lab-based experiments that incorporate more behaviorally-relevant features of children's learning environments such as the capacity to respond contingent on the child's actions (see @benitez2018predictable for an example of studying word learning with a gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigm).
  
In sum, we set out to explore how children's information seeking adapts to a wide range of social contexts during two ecologically-relevant language tasks: familiar word comprehension and novel word learning. We found that children's real-time information seeking is quite flexible: when it was useful for language processing, children adapted their gaze to seek language-relevant information form social partners. Moreover, children and adults showed evidence of differential learning of new words when social gaze directed their visual attention. This work highlights two critical, open challenges for an integrated account of active learning within social contexts: (1) developing a more precise quantitative model of how interactions with other people change the utility of information seeking actions. By formalizing how social contexts can change the cost and value of actions, researchers could make more precise predictions about how social reasoning should interact with children's active learning. (2) Future empirical work should move beyond highly-constrained lab experiments to document information seeking behaviors within social contexts in children's everyday learning environments. Despite these open challenges, the integrative framework presented in this thesis represents a way forward for understanding how children's active learning interacts with social learning environments, which are ubiquitous in children's lives.
