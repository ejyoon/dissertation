# Conclusion {-#conclusion}

In this dissertation, I proposed a framework for understanding children's information seeking decisions within social contexts. The core of the argument is that the presence of other people can change the *availability* and *usefulness* of information seeking behaviors by shaping learners' goals, hypotheses, actions, answers, and thresholds for stopping information gathering. Following the theoretical account, I presented a set of empirical studies that explored whether the dynamics of children's real-time information selection via their eye movements flexibly adapts to gather social information that supported language processing.

Chapter 2 investigated how children learning American Sign Language (ASL) distributed visual attention between the linguistic signal and referents, which both compete for visual attention. Similar to children learning spoken language, ASL learners shifted gaze away from a social partner to seek objects before sign offset, providing evidence that, despite channel competition, language drove rapid shifts in visual attention to named referents during ASL processing. Chapter 3 extended the sign language research by directly comparing ASL learners' gaze dynamics to those of children learning spoken English using parallel real-time language comprehension tasks. Chapter 3 also presented a comparison of English-learning children and adults' eye movements in noisy vs. clear auditory contexts. In both ASL and noisy speech contexts, listeners adapted their gaze to seek additional language-relevant information from social partners before shifting gaze to a named referent. Chapters 4 and 5 explored how information-seeking eye movements change when children and adults processed novel words accompanied by social cues to reference. The social gaze work suggests that learners integrate their uncertainty over word-object mappings to decide when to seek social information, which in turn, modulates the input to statistical word learning mechanisms. 

The integrative account and the empirical work described here are limited in several important ways. First, the majority of this research tested binary hypotheses of behavior change -- i.e., sign vs. spoken language; noisy vs. clear speech; word learning with vs. without social gaze -- to answer the question of *whether* children would flexibly adapt their information seeking in response to changes in the processing environment. Chapters 2-5 present evidence across a diverse set of case studies that children's real-time information seeking is quite flexible. However, to move the integrative account forward, we would want to develop a fully-specified model that could make quantitative predictions about how social contexts will change the utility of information seeking behaviors. This step will require formalizing the value and cost of information-seeking actions in a modeling framework that can incorporate the effects of reasoning about other people's mental states. 

We have taken some initial steps towards this goal by developing a model of active-social learning that integrates ideas from Optimal Experiment Design (OED) with formalizations of recursive social reasoning from Bayesian models of pragmatic language interpretation [@goodman2016pragmatic]. We found that this integrated model was able to reproduce the qualitative patterns in adults' decisions of whether to forego information seeking in favor of more immediately rewarding actions when their social partner highlighted performance and presentational goals [@yoon2018balancing]. The integrative account described here directly inspired this line of research, and I hope that future versions of the model will be able to generate graded, testable predictions for behavior across a variety of domains -- e.g., eye movements, early vocalizations, and verbal question asking.

Second, we used one particular formalization of active inquiry. The OED model focuses on learners' information-seeking decision given a specific goal to learn and a set of candidate hypotheses. There are, however, other computational frameworks that have formalized active learning in different ways. For example, foraging models pursue the analogy that human information seeking is similar to animals' decisions about where and how long to look for food if they were trying to maximize caloric intake while minimizing their effort and time (see @pirolli1999information for a review). Cognitive scientists have successfully modeled a range of behaviors as foraging in space, such as searching for semantic concepts in memory [@hills2012optimal] and decisions about where to direct visual attention in real-time [@manohar2013attention]. In addition to these search models, recent theories of curiosity-based learning in developmental robotics have developed algorithms that optimize intrinsic estimates of learning progress. This formalization creates systems that focus on seeking activities and stimuli of intermediate complexity where learners' predictions are steadily improving, and uncertainty is steadily decreasing [@oudeyer2016evolution]. One of the challenges for researchers trying to integrate active and social learning is that the space of possible connections is quite large. By constraining our account to active decision making, we were able to make some progress on an important sub-component of a larger set of children's information seeking behaviors. Future theoretical work, however, could think about connections between social learning phenomena and the foraging/curiosity-based learning frameworks.

Third, our ultimate goal for the integrative active-social account is to incorporate effects at a developmental timescale. The experiments in this thesis, however, often treated children and adults as two endpoints on a continuum, exploring parallels and differences between children's information seeking and our best estimate of the mature state of the language processing system -- adults' behavior. The final experiment in Chapter 5 represents an exception where we measured adaptation of information seeking over the slightly longer timescales -- i.e., multiple exposures to novel word-object links and in the context of highly familiar words, which children learned through exposure to many prior labeling events in their day-to-day experience. 

While the study in Chapter 5 is a useful first step, future work should measure change over a longer timescale by densely sampling children at different ages and points of development. For example, it would be useful to know the effect of children's rapidly improving productive language skills, which increases the set of information seeking actions available by allowing children to ask verbal questions. One prediction based on our account is that seeking social information via eye movements should become less useful when children can ask "What is this thing called?" Another example is children's rapid theory of mind development. Our account predicts that young children should focus more on learning goals if they are less skilled at reasoning about others' beliefs. But, as their social reasoning abilities mature and their social environments become more complex, children may start to emphasize performance or presentation goals to update others' beliefs and appear competent.

Finally, the empirical research described here aimed to understand how children's information seeking behaviors adapt to support their language processing. To accomplish this, we measured changes in children's gaze dynamics during language comprehension and word learning in highly-simplified settings. This approach has the benefit of providing a high degree of experimenter control and relatively well-understood linking hypothesis going from observable behavior (eye movements) to underlying psychological constructs (e.g., lexical access) [@tanenhaus2000eye]. The risk, however, is that the responses that we can measure in the lab do not reflect behaviors that support children's learning in their natural environments. That is, children learn their first language from conversations where there are dynamic and contingent responses from social partners, who also play a role in controlling the flow of the experience. This gap suggests two critical next steps for this research described here: (1) measure changes in children's information seeking within free-flowing social interactions with their caregivers (see @franchak2011head for an example of this approach using head-mounted cameras). And (2) develop more realistic lab-based experiments that incorporate behaviorally-relevant features of children's learning environments such as contingent responding to child's actions (see @benitez2018predictable for an example of studying word learning using a gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigm).
  
In sum, we set out to explore how children's information seeking adapts to a wide range of social contexts during two ecologically-relevant language tasks: familiar word comprehension and novel word learning. We found that children's real-time information seeking is quite flexible. When useful for language processing, children adapted their gaze to seek language-relevant information form social partners. Moreover, children and adults showed evidence of differential learning of new words when social gaze guided their visual attention. This work highlighted two critical, open challenges for an integrated account of information-seeking within social contexts: (1) develop a more precise quantitative model of how interactions with other people change the utility of information seeking behaviors and (2) move beyond highly-constrained lab experiments to document information seeking behaviors in natural learning environments. Despite these challenges, the integrative framework presented in this thesis represents a way forward for understanding how children's information seeking adapts to the wide variety of social environments in which children acquire their first language.
