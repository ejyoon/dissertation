In this dissertation, I proposed a framework for understanding how children's information seeking adapts to features of their social learning environments. The core of the argument is that 

Following the  presented a set of empirical work that explored whether the dynamics of children's real time information selection via eye movements flexibly adapt to support their comprehension and learning. 

Chapter 2 investigated how children learning American Sign Language (ASL)  allocate attention betweeen language and objects, which both compete for visual attention. Similar to children leanring spoken language, ASL learners shifted gaze away from a social partner to seek objects before sign offset, providing evidence that, despite the higher value of fixating on a signer, grounded language drove rapid shifts in attention to named referents during ASL processing. Chapter 3 extended the sign language research by directly comparing ASL learners' gaze dynamics to children learning spoken English on parallel language comprehension tasks. Chapter 3 also described a comparison of English-learning children and adult's eye movements in noisy auditory contexts. Both ASL learners and children processing speech in noise showed parallel adaptations to the higher value of looking to their social partner to gather language-relevant information before shifting gaze seek a named referent. Chapters 4 and 5 explored how the information seeking changed when children and adults were processing words in the context of social cues to reference. Taken together, the results suggest people integrate uncertainty over word-object mappings with the availability of social information to guide their eye movements and modulate the information that comes into contact with statistical learning mechansims. 

Discuss limitations of the current work while highlighting the generative nature of this framework: 
  - empirical work is still at the point of testing binary hypotheses. Would be useful to model and quantify notions of value and cost. 
    - simple RSA models that ask questions to informative vs. uniformative teacher
    - RSA models that are modified to select between different information seeking actions whie reasoning about others' beliefs. (cite recent work with Erica)
  - other formal accounts of information seeking, focused on different kinds of problems that could be well-suited to model 
  - account of curosity-based learning that falls outside the scope of this integrative active-social decision-making account
  - empirical work that goes beyond highly-controlled lab experiments and measures information seeking in the wild
  - empirical work that incoporates the back-and-forth dynamic of early language interaction -- that both the child and their social partner are active in controlling the flow of experience. draw on models of turn-taking in conversation
  
In sum, children's real-time information seeking skills are quite flexible, adapting to the informational demands of their learning environments to support language processing. Two critical challenges for an account of active learning within social contexts are (1) to develop a more precise quantitative understanding of how interactions with other people change the utility of information seeking actions. By formalizing the notions of active and social learning, researchers can start to make quantitative predictions that tease apart competing hypotheses for how social contexts constrain information seeking. And (2) empirical work should move beyond the highly-constrained lab experiments to document the opportunity and effects of social contexts on information seeking in children's everyday learning environments. Despite these challenges, the integrative framework presented in this thesis represents a way forward for understanding how children's active information seeking integrates with the rich information provided by their social partners.
