# Conclusion {-#conclusion}

In this dissertation, I proposed a framework for understanding children's information-seeking decisions within social contexts. The core of the argument is that the presence of other people can change the *availability* and *usefulness* of information-seeking behaviors by shaping learners' goals, hypotheses, actions, answers, and thresholds for stopping information gathering. Following the theoretical framework, I presented a set of empirical studies that explored whether the dynamics of children's real-time information selection via their eye movements flexibly adapts to gather social information that supports language processing.

Chapter 2 investigated how children learning American Sign Language (ASL) distributed visual attention between the linguistic signal and referents, which both compete for visual attention. Similar to children learning spoken language, ASL learners shifted gaze away from a social partner to seek objects before sign offset, providing evidence that, despite channel competition, language drove rapid shifts in visual attention to named referents. Chapter 3 extended the sign language research by directly comparing ASL learners' gaze dynamics to those of children learning spoken English using parallel real-time language comprehension tasks. Chapter 3 also presented a comparison of English-learning children and adults' eye movements in noisy vs. clear auditory contexts. In both the ASL and noisy speech cases, listeners adapted their gaze to seek additional language-relevant information from social partners before shifting to seek a named referent. Chapters 4 and 5 explored how eye movements change when children and adults processed familiar and novel words accompanied by social cues to reference. Taken together, the social gaze work suggests that children integrate their uncertainty over word-object mappings to decide when to seek social information, which in turn, modulates the input to statistical word learning.

The integrative framework and empirical work described here are limited in several important ways. First, the majority of this research tested binary hypotheses of behavior change -- i.e., sign vs. spoken language; noisy vs. clear speech; word learning with vs. without social gaze -- to answer the question of whether children would flexibly adapt their information seeking in response to changes in their processing environments. Chapters 2-5 present evidence across a diverse set of case studies that children's real-time information seeking is quite flexible. However, to move the integrative framework forward, we would want to develop a fully-specified model that could make quantitative predictions about how social contexts will change the utility of information-seeking behaviors. This step will require formalizing the notions of value and cost of information-seeking actions in a modeling framework that can incorporate the effects of reasoning about other people's mental states. 

We have taken some initial steps towards this goal by developing a model of active-social learning that integrates ideas from Optimal Experiment Design (OED) with formalizations of recursive social reasoning from Bayesian models of pragmatic language interpretation [@goodman2016pragmatic]. We found that this integrated model was able to reproduce the qualitative patterns in adults' decisions of whether to forego information seeking in favor of more immediately rewarding actions when their social partner highlighted performance and presentational goals [@yoon2018balancing]. The integrative framework described here directly inspired this line of research, and I hope that future versions of the model will be able to generate graded, testable predictions for behavior across a variety of domains -- e.g., eye movements, early vocalizations, and verbal question asking.

Second, we used one particular formalization of active inquiry. The OED model focuses on learners' information-seeking decisions given a specific goal to learn and a set of candidate hypotheses. Other computational frameworks have formalized active learning in different ways. For example, foraging models pursue the analogy that human information seeking is similar to animals' decisions about where and how long to look for food if they were trying to maximize caloric intake while minimizing their effort and time (see @pirolli1999information for a review). Cognitive scientists have successfully modeled a range of behaviors as a form of spatial foraging, such as searching for semantic concepts in memory [@hills2012optimal] and decisions about where to direct visual attention in real-time [@manohar2013attention]. In addition to these search models, recent work on curiosity-based learning in developmental robotics has created algorithms that optimize intrinsic estimates of learning progress. This formalization creates systems that focus on seeking activities and stimuli of intermediate complexity where learners' predictions are steadily improving, and uncertainty is steadily decreasing [@oudeyer2016evolution]. One of the challenges for researchers trying to integrate active and social learning is that the space of possible connections is quite large. By constraining our framework to active decision making, we were able to make some progress on an important sub-component of a larger set of children's information-seeking behaviors. Future theoretical work, however, should consider possible connections between social learning phenomena and the foraging/curiosity-based learning frameworks.

Third, our ultimate goal for the active-social framework is to incorporate effects at a developmental timescale. The experiments in this thesis, however, often treated children and adults as two endpoints on a continuum, exploring parallels and differences between children's information seeking and our best estimate of the mature state of the language processing system. We did find some clear patterns of developmental change. In Chapter 3, adults were faster to respond to familiar words, generated more language-consistent shifts, and produced fewer early shifts before accumulating enough information. Older children were also faster to respond than younger children but did not generate more language-consistent shifts overall. Older children did, however, produce fewer early, non-language-driven gaze shifts. This pattern of results suggests that what might be developing is an ability to inhibit a behavior -- shifting gaze away from the language source -- that reduces access to information that is useful for figuring out the identity of a named referent. Prior work also shows that children develop greater flexibility in ignoring irrelevant information to focus on parts of the meaningful parts of a sentence [@zangl2007increasing]. But it is still an open question as to how children's visual information seeking might change as they become more efficient in processing words and develop their skill in focusing on relevant information in their environment.

In addition to change at the developmental timescale, the final experiment in Chapter 5 represents an exception where we measured adaptation of information seeking over the slightly longer timescale of multiple exposures to novel word-object links and in the context of highly familiar words, which children learned through exposure to many prior labeling events in their day-to-day lives. While the study in Chapter 5 is a useful first step, future work should measure change over a longer timescale by densely sampling children at different ages and points of development. For example, it would be useful to know the effect of children's rapidly improving productive language skills, which increases the set of information-seeking actions available by allowing children to ask verbal questions. One prediction based on our framework is that seeking social information via eye movements should become less useful when children can produce the verbal question "What is this thing called?" since it has a higher probability of returning useful information. Another example is children's rapid theory of mind development. Our framework predicts that young children should focus more on learning goals if they are less skilled at reasoning about others' beliefs. But, as their social reasoning abilities mature and their social environments become more complex, children may forego information seeking actions that make them appear incompetent to their social partners.

Fourth, our account is currently underdeveloped concerning individual differences. That is, the model was designed to explore general principles about how qualitative changes to the social environment might shape children's information seeking actions. However, it is possible to use the active-social framework to understand how individual differences in children's input and cognitive abilities might interact to shape how they decide to seek information from social partners. For example, prior research has found that adults vary in the proportion of unambiguous naming episodes they provide, with some parents rarely providing highly informative contexts and othersâ€™ doing so relatively more often [@cartmill2013quality]. Within our active-social framework, this differential experience could be instantiated as children learning a model of the probability of getting a high-quality answer when they ask a question. If children do not expect an answer is likely, then this should reduce information seeking even if there is a social partner available. We did find some evidence of this effect in Chapters 4 and 5 where adults were less likely to use an unreliable social cue to reference and where children looked more to a social partner who provided gaze cue than to one who did not.

Individual differences in cognitive abilities could also be included in our model. Prior research shows variability in children's theory of mind and inhibitory control abilities [@carlson2001individual], in addition to the considerable variability in language processing skill [@marchman2008speed]. Within our active-social framework, children with a more-developed theory of mind skill might place a higher weight on pursuing social goals over and above informational goals, taking actions that maintain others' beliefs about their abilities. It could also be that stronger perspective-taking skills help children reason about the probability of getting a quality answer from another person, thus modulating whom they choose to ask questions (e.g., seeking information from an expert vs. a novice). Another compelling possibility is that children who have stronger domain-general processing abilities are better able to update their beliefs based on the information they receive, and thus reducing the amount of time they spend seeking information from social partners. These are all interesting, open questions for future research that fall out of the integrative active-social framework proposed in this thesis. 

Finally, the empirical research described here aimed to understand how children's information-seeking behaviors adapt to support their language processing. To accomplish this, we measured changes in children's gaze dynamics during language comprehension and word learning in simplified environments. This approach has the benefit of providing a high degree of experimenter control and a relatively well-understood hypothesis linking observable behavior (eye movements) to underlying psychological constructs (e.g., lexical access) [@tanenhaus2000eye]. The risk, however, is that the responses that we can measure in the lab do not reflect behaviors that support children's learning in their natural environments. That is, children acquire their first language from conversations where social partners produce contingent responses and take actions that control the flow of children's learning experience. This gap suggests two critical next steps for the research described here: (1) measure changes in children's information seeking within free-flowing social interactions with their caregivers (see @franchak2018see for a recent example of this approach using head-mounted eye trackers), and (2) develop more realistic lab-based experiments that incorporate behaviorally-relevant features of children's learning environments such as contingent responding to children's actions (see @benitez2018predictable for an example of studying word learning using a gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigm).
  
In sum, we set out to explore how children's eye movements adapt to a wide range of social contexts during two ecologically-relevant tasks: familiar language comprehension and novel word learning. We found that children could adapt their gaze to seek relevant social information when it was useful for language processing. Moreover, children and adults showed evidence of differential learning of new words when social gaze guided their visual attention. This work highlighted two critical, open challenges for a framework of information-seeking within social contexts: (1) develop a precise quantitative model of how social learning can change the utility of information-seeking behaviors, and (2) move beyond highly-constrained lab experiments to document information seeking behaviors in children's natural learning environments. Despite these challenges, the integrative framework presented in this thesis represents a way forward for understanding how children's information seeking adapts to the wide variety of social environments in which children acquire their first language.
