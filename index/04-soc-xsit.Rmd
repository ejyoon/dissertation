\chaptermark{Social cues modulate word learning} 

In this chapter, we present a series of studies exploring adults' word learning in the presence of social cues that disambiguate reference. Within our broader active-social framework, these experiments investigate how social information changes statistical word learning by (1) providing stronger information (i.e., answers) about the target word-object link and (2) constraining the number of potential word-object links (i.e., hypotheses) that learners track over time. Overall, this line of work brings together ideas from social-pragmatic and statistical accounts of language acquisition to explore how social cues can shape the representations that support cross-situational word learning. 

Because learners hear language in environments that contain many things to talk about, figuring out the meaning of even the simplest word requires making inferences under uncertainty. A cross-situational statistical learner can aggregate across naming events to form stable word-referent mappings, but this approach neglects an important source of information that can reduce referential uncertainty: social cues from speakers (e.g., eye gaze). In four large-scale experiments with adults, we tested the effects of varying referential uncertainty in cross-situational word learning using social cues. Social cues shifted learners away from tracking multiple hypotheses and towards storing only a single hypothesis (Experiments 1 and 2). Also, learners were sensitive to graded changes in the strength of a social cue, and when it became less reliable, they were more likely to store multiple hypotheses (Experiment 3). Finally, learners stored fewer word-referent mappings in the presence of a social cue even when given the opportunity to visually inspect the objects for the same amount of time (Experiment 4). These results suggest that the representations underlying cross-situational word learning of concrete object labels flexibly respond to uncertainty in the input. And when ambiguity is high, learners tend to store a broader range of information.
