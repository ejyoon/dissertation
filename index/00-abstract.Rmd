We use polite speech on a daily basis. From “thanks” and “please” to “your dress is cute” to “these cookies could use a bit of salt,” people often produce polite utterances that are indirect or even false to some degree. Why do people speak politely? This thesis proposes a goal-based account of polite speech, that polite speech arises from a set of competing social goals: the speaker’s desire to transfer information in the most truthful and informative manner possible (“informational goal”), and to abide by social norms and expectations and/or maintain the interactants’ *face* or public self-image (“pro-social goal”) and/or present herself as a particular kind of individual (e.g., kind, helpful person; “self-presentational goal”). In Chapter 1, I provide an overview of this integrative theoretical framework that aims to unify previous theoretical accounts of polite speech and explain existing empirical studies on understanding and production of polite speech in adults and children. In Chapter 2, I provide a computational model that formalizes the notion of goals as utilities that speakers try to maximize through language use, and show that this model successfully captures adults’ predictions and judgments for polite lies and indirect speech. Then I present two sets of empirical studies looking at the development of polite language understanding: 2- to 4-year-old children’s judgments for polite requests (Chapter 3) and 5- to 8-year-old children’s judgments for polite lies versus blunt truths (Chapter 4). Overall, the work presented in this thesis reveals how adults and children’s understanding of polite speech reflects their understanding of speaker goals to be informative and social.
