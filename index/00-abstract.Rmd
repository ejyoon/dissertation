Children's early language development is one of the more remarkable features of human cognition. How do they learn so much despite ambiguous input and limited processing capabilities? Social learning theories argue for the importance of acquiring language from more knowledgeable adults who constrain the learning task. Statistical learning accounts emphasize the role of pattern detection and structure in children's language environments. Finally, active learning explanations focus on children's skill in seeking information to support their own learning. This thesis presents an integrative framework for unifying key ideas from each account to explain how children seek information from social targets during signed and spoken language processing.

Chapter 1 presents an integrative account of information seeking within social contexts, arguing that the formalization of Optimal Experiment Design (OED) is a useful theoretical tool to bring together ideas from social and active learning accounts of cognitive development. The following four chapters describe a set of empirical work that uses children's eye movements as a case study of early informaation seeking during language processing and word learning. In Chapter 2, I present  the first case study of children's eye movements during real-time comprehension of American Sign Language (ASL) where both referents and language compete for visual attention. Chapter 3 describes a direct comparison of eye movements of young children learning spoken English to children learning ASL, showing evidence that ASL-learners are sensitive to the higher value of fixating on social partners in a visual-manual language. Chapter 4 explores how the presence of visual cues to reference (speaker's eye gaze) modulates adults' distribution of attention and memory during cross-situational word learning. Finally, Chapter 5 describes an eye tracking study that asks how information seeking from social targets changes over the course of learning as children build stronger word-object links via exposures to word-object co-occurrence information.
