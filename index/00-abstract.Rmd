We use polite speech on a daily basis. From “thanks” and “please” to “your dress is cute” and “these cookies could use a bit of salt,” people often produce polite utterances that are indirect or even false to some degree. Why do people speak politely? This thesis proposes a goal-based framework to explain polite speech, that polite speech arises from competing informational and social concerns: for example, the speaker’s desire to transfer information in the most truthful and informative manner possible (“informational goal”), and to abide by social norms and expectations and/or maintain the interactants’ *face* or public self-image (“prosocial goal”) and/or present herself as a particular kind of individual (e.g., kind, helpful person; “self-presentational goal”). 
In Chapter 1, I provide an overview of this integrative theoretical framework that aims to unify previous theoretical accounts of polite speech and describe existing empirical data on understanding and production of polite speech in adults and children. 
Then I present two sets of our own empirical studies looking at the development of polite language understanding in children: 2- to 4-year-old children’s judgments for polite requests (Chapter 2) and 5- to 8-year-old children’s judgments for polite lies versus blunt truths (Chapter 3). 
Results from these studies show that children are sensitive to speakers' social concerns behind language use, and that they consider tradeoffs between those goals based on the context at hand.
In Chapter 4, I examine adults' understanding of polite speech: I present a computational model that formalizes the notion of goals as utilities that speakers try to maximize through language use, and show that this model successfully captures adults’ predictions and judgments for polite lies and indirect speech. 
Overall, the work presented in this thesis reveals how children's and adults' understanding of polite speech reflects their understanding of speakers' informational and social goals and tradeoffs between them, and helps advance our knowledge of pragmatics and social cognition in general.
