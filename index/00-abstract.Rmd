We use polite speech on a daily basis. 
We produce not only simple words of apology ("sorry") or gratitude ("thanks"), but also more complex polite utterances (“these cookies could use a bit of salt” or "your dress is gorgeous!").
Why do people speak politely? 
This thesis proposes a goal-based framework to explain polite speech, that polite speech arises from competing informational and social concerns
such as the speaker’s desire to transfer information in the most truthful and informative manner possible (“informational goal”), and to abide by social norms and expectations and/or maintain the interactants’ *face* or public self-image (“prosocial goal”) and/or present herself as a particular kind of individual (e.g., kind, helpful person; “self-presentational goal”). 
In Chapter 1, I provide an overview of this theoretical framework that aims to unify previous accounts of polite speech, and then I describe existing empirical data on comprehension and production of polite speech in adults and children. 
Then I present our own empirical studies investigating adults' and children's understanding of polite language.
First, I present two sets of empirical studies looking at the development of polite language understanding in children: a study examining 2- to 4-year-old children’s judgments for polite requests (Chapter 2), followed by a study probing 5- to 8-year-old children’s judgments for polite lies versus blunt truths (Chapter 3). 
Results from these studies show that children are sensitive to speakers' social concerns behind language use, and that they consider tradeoffs between those goals based on the context at hand.
In Chapter 4, we examine adults' understanding of polite speech: We present a computational model that formalizes the notion of goals as utilities that speakers try to maximize through language use, and show that this model successfully captures adults’ predictions and judgments for polite lies and indirect speech. 
Overall, the work presented in this thesis reveals how children's and adults' understanding of polite speech reflects their understanding of speakers' informational and social goals and tradeoffs between them, and helps advance our knowledge of pragmatics and social cognition in general.
