Children's rapid conceptual development is one of the more remarkable features of human cognition. How do they learn so much so quickly? Social learning theories argue for the importance of learning from rich input provided by more knowledgeable others. In contrast, active learning accounts focus on children's efficient information seeking skills as a path to knowledge acquisition. In this paper, I suggest that an important step towards a complete theory of early learning is to understand how active learning unfolds within social contexts. To integrate the two accounts, I use the theory of Optimal Experiment Design (OED), which formalizes human inquiry as a decision process that maximizes expected utility with respect to the goal of gaining new information. I argue that this integration allows for recent insights into children's social learning to increase our understanding of how children make information gathering decisions that often occur within social contexts.
