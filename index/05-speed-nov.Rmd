# Seeking social and statisical information

In this chapter, we present three studies of eye movements in the presence of a social gaze cue during language comprehension and word learning. Within our broader active-social framework, these studies ask how the value of information gained from querying a social partner interacts with children's developing knowledge of word meanings. This approach brings together elements of all three pieces of the integrative account -- social, statistical, and active -- presented in Chapter 1. 

We measured how children's decisions about whether to look at a social target (a speaker's face) or at objects changed as a function of their word knowledge. First, both children and adults showed parallel gaze dynamics when comprehending familiar words in the presence of a social cue (eye gaze). Second, in a cross-situational word learning task, adults showed stronger memory for word-object mappings learned via a social cue. Finally, in contrast to the familiar words in Experiment 1, both children and adults gathered more visual information from a speaker's face when she provided a useful gaze cue in the context novel object labeling. This differential looking to a social partner increased over the course of the experiment, as learners were exposed to more word-object co-occurrence information. Together, these results provide evidence that learners will look more to a social partner when it supports their current task, and estimating this value involves an integration of prior knowledge of word-object mappings with the availability of social information in the learning context.
