# Integrating statistical and social information during language comprehension and word learning

\chaptermark{Seeking social information during language processing} 

In this chapter, I present three studies that explore how the presence of a social cue to reference (a speaker's gaze) changes listeners' decisions about visual fixation during language comprehension and word learning. Within our broader active-social framework, these studies ask how the value of information gained from fixating on (i.e., querying) a social partner interacts with learners' developing knowledge of word meanings (i.e., hypotheses) to modulate their information accumulation thresholds (i.e., stopping rules). This work brings together the core elements -- active, social, and statistical -- of the integrative account described in Chapter 1.

Children process language in complex environments where there are often many things to talk about. How do they understand and learn words despite this noisy input? Statistical learning accounts emphasize that children can aggregate consistent word-object co-occurrences across multiple labeling events to reduce uncertainty over time. Social-pragmatic theories argue that interactions with social partners support learning by reducing ambiguity within individual labeling events. Here, we present three eye-tracking studies that ask how children integrate statistical and social information during real-time language processing. First, children and adults did not delay their gaze shifts to gather a post-nominal social cue to reference (another speakerâ€™s eye gaze). Second, when processing novel words, adults fixated more on a speaker who provided a disambiguating gaze and showed stronger recall for word-object links learned via the social cue. Finally, in contrast to the familiar word context, children and adults fixated longer on a speaker who produced a gaze cue when labeling novel objects, which, in turn, led to increased looking to the named object and less looking to the other objects in the scene. Moreover, children, but not adults, increased their looking to the interlocutor throughout the experiment. Together, these results suggest that learners flexibly integrate their knowledge of object labels to decide whether to seek social information, which then shapes the information that comes into contact with statistical learning mechanisms.
