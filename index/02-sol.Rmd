\chaptermark{Information seeking during ASL processing} 

This chapter presents a study of eye movements in a visual-manual language (American Sign Language: ASL). ASL is a compelling case because children use visual fixation to gather information about referents and the linguistic signal. In contrast, children learning spoken language can look away from their social partners while gathering more linguistic information. Within the broader active-social framework, this study asks whether ASL-learners' visual information seeking actions (i.e., queries) look dramatically different given the constraints of processing a visual language in real time or by having differential access to auditory information in day-to-day life.

To answer this question, we measured eye movements during real-time ASL comprehension of 29 native ASL-learning children (16-53 mos, 16 deaf, 13 hearing) and 16 fluent deaf adult signers. All signers showed evidence of incremental language comprehension, tending to initiate an eye movement before sign offset. Moreover, Deaf and hearing ASL-learners showed remarkably similar gaze patterns. Finally, variation in childrenâ€™s ASL processing was positively correlated with age and vocabulary size. These results suggest that, despite competition for attention within a single modality, signers will use visual attention to rapidly gather information about signs and seek named objects in ways that parallel spoken language processing. Moreover, these results suggest that the timing and accuracy of visual fixations in ASL reflect language-relevant information processing skills.
