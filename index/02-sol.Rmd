# Eye movements during American Sign Language comprehension ^[This chapter is published in @macdonald2018real. Real-time lexical comprehension in young children learning American Sign Language. *Developmental science*, e12672.]

In this chapter, we present a study of eye movements in a visual-manual language (American Sign Language: ASL). ASL is an interesting case because visual information about the referents and the linguistic signal are gathered through the same mechanism: visual fixations. In contrast, children learning spoken language can look away from their social partners while gathering more linguistic information. Within our broader active-social framework, this study asks whether ASL-learners' visual information seeking (i.e., queries) would look dramatically different given the constraints of processing a visual language in real time or by having differential access to auditory information in day-to-day life.

To answer this question, we measured eye movements during real-time ASL comprehension of 29 native ASL-learning children (16-53 mos, 16 deaf, 13 hearing) and 16 fluent deaf adult signers. All signers showed evidence of incremental language comprehension, tending to initiate an eye movement before sign offset. Moreover, Deaf and hearing ASL-learners showed remarkably similar gaze patterns. Finally, variation in childrenâ€™s ASL processing was positively correlated with age and vocabulary size. These results suggest that, despite competition for attention within a single modality, signers will shift visual attention to seek named objects in ways that parallel spoken language processing and that the timing and accuracy of these fixations reflect language-relevant information processing skills.
