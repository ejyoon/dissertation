# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content here or
# use code similar to line 20 for the files.  If you are producing in a different
# format than PDF, you can delete or ignore lines 20-31 in this YAML header.

  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00-abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab is 
# needed on the line after the |.

  This dissertation would not have been possible without the support of the Deaf community. I am grateful to the California School for the Deaf in Fremont, CA and to the families who participated in this research. Special thanks to Karina Pedersen, Lisalee Egbert, Laura Petersen, Michele Berke, Sean Virnig, Pearlene Utley, and Rosa Lee Timm.
  
  I am also thankful for the developmental community at Stanford. This research was improved thanks to the feedback from my cohort, my labmates in the Language and Cognition Lab, and the members of the Language Learning and Social Cognition labs. 

  I have been fortunate to work with incredible mentors during my time at Stanford. Thank you to Anne Fernald, Virginia Marchman, and Hyo Gweon for all your support and for spending many hours providing feedback on the ideas in the dissertation. I am especially grateful to my advisor, Michael Frank, who has been a great advocate and mentor. Thank you for all of your patience and kindness and for showing me how to think clearly and do good science.

  I am also grateful to have met some wonderful friends while completing this research. Kara Weisman, MH Tessler, and Erica Yoon, I'm happy we went through this together, and I appreciate your support along with the way. 

  None of what I have accomplished would be possible without the unconditional love and support from my parents, Morag and Richard MacDonald. Thank you for all you have done for me. I thank my sister, Kaitlin, for always being there when I needed to someone to talk to. Finally, I thank my partner, Ellika, for everything. My days begin and end with you, and for this, I couldn't be more grateful.

  I dedicate this dissertation to the memory of my grandmother, Sheila Paget. Thank you for being my greatest supporter and for always encouraging me to ask questions.

<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for
PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.  You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd
and 00-abstract.Rmd since they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.
